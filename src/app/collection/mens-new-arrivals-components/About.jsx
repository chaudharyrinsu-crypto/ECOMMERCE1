                <h3>THE DETAILS</h3>
                <p>Crafted using bio-fabrication, designed for movement, and built for modern ambition, the Cruiser Terralux™ combines iconic Allbirds comfort with our most refined styling to date—because comfort doesn’t have to be casual.</p>

                <h3>MATERIALLY BETTER</h3>
                <p>We partnered with Modern Meadow—a pioneer in synthetic biology and material science—to bring INNOVERA™ to footwear for the first time. It’s crafted from plant-based proteins, biopolymers, and post-consumer waste for the look and feel of leather with a lighter footprint.</p>

                <p>We recommend spot cleaning with warm water and a gentle soap whenever your shoes need a brush up.</p>
